The S-coordinate system is an advanced mathematical framework that transforms 2D pixel coordinates into an abstract coordinate space for sophisticated depth map generation. Unlike traditional brightness-based depth mapping, this system uses geometric positioning influenced by color properties to create multiple depth calculation possibilities.
Core Methodology
Phase 1: Coordinate Space Transformation
Code

Image Pixel (x,y) → Normalized Coordinates → S-Space (sX,sY) → Depth Value

Process:

    Pixel coordinates normalized to [-1, +1] range, centered on image
    S-bounds parameter defines the abstract coordinate space (±5.0 default)
    Color properties (luminosity/saturation) modulate the mapping boundaries
    Final S-coordinates position each pixel in the abstract mathematical space

Phase 2: Color-Guided Positioning
JavaScript

effectiveRange = baseRange × (1 + luminosity×0.7 + saturation×0.3)

Color Influence:

    Bright pixels → Pushed toward S-space periphery
    Saturated pixels → Also moved toward edges
    Dark/dull pixels → Remain near S-space center
    Color acts as guidance, not direct depth determination

Phase 3: Geometric Depth Algorithms
Sum XY S-Coordinates (Current Default)

    Formula: depth = |sX| + |sY| (Manhattan distance)
    Effect: Center appears farthest, corners/edges appear closest
    Pattern: Creates geometric depth gradients

Nuit Distance Method

    Formula: depth = 1/(1 + distance_from_boundary × falloff)
    Effect: Maximum depth occurs at circular boundary (Nuit radius)
    Pattern: Circular depth enhancement around specified radius

Radial Zones

    Formula: depth = 1 - (distance_from_origin / max_distance)
    Effect: Center closest, edges farthest
    Pattern: Traditional radial depth distribution

Hybrid Algorithm

    Formula: Combines radial base with Nuit boundary enhancement
    Effect: Radial foundation plus circular depth boost
    Pattern: Complex geometric depth interaction

Technical Architecture
Real-Time Processing Pipeline

    Video Frame Capture → Canvas processing at configurable quality

Stereoscopic Implementation

    Left Eye Shift: sourceX = x + (depth × intensity)
    Right Eye Shift: sourceX = x - (depth × intensity)

Advanced Capabilities
Mathematical Sophistication

    Multi-dimensional transformation from pixel space to abstract coordinates
    Weighted color modulation rather than direct color-to-depth mapping
    Multiple geometric interpretation algorithms operating on unified coordinate system
    Real-time parameter adjustment with live visual feedback

System Advantages

    Separation of Concerns: Spatial positioning separated from depth calculation
    Geometric Control: Mathematical rather than purely visual depth determination
    Color Guidance: Uses color properties to influence rather than determine depth
    Multiple Algorithms: Four different depth calculation methods on same coordinate system
    Real-time Flexibility: Live parameter adjustment without reprocessing
    Mathematical Consistency: Unified framework across all depth methods

Innovation Summary

The S-coordinate system represents a significant advancement in real-time depth mapping by creating an intermediate mathematical space where:

    Position and color combine to determine abstract coordinates
    Geometric algorithms interpret these coordinates for depth
    Multiple depth patterns can be generated from the same coordinate foundation
    Real-time control allows dynamic adjustment of depth characteristics

This approach enables sophisticated stereoscopic effects that go far beyond traditional brightness-to-depth mapping, providing mathematical control over depth distribution patterns while maintaining real-time performance.
