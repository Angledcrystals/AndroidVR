This is simple to use, simply relax your eyes to allow both images to drift together.

This tool starts from the pixel; the most basic point of light in an image. 

But instead of treating each pixel as a flat bit of color, It is treated as a living unit of perception. 

Every pixel contains two critical qualities: brightness and saturation. Brightness is used as a measure of presence or nearness, and saturation as a sense of density or form. Together, they become the raw material for a new kind of depth.

My tool reads these values across an image and creates a spatial field; not using traditional 3D geometry or camera-based depth maps.

The result is a depth matrix.

Here are the suggested values for creating depth in AndroidVR.
